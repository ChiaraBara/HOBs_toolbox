Demonstration scripts
_____________________
Simulation - Computation and statistical assessment of the predictability- and entropy-based WMS metrics for a single realization of the four simulation settings employed in the first reference (load data_sim.mat).  
Application -  Computation and statistical assessment of the predictability- and entropy-based WMS metrics by accounting for 1) mean arterial pressure (MAP), diastolic arterial pressure (DAP) and systolic arterial pressure (SAP), and 2) diatolic arterial pressure (DAP), pre-ejection period (PEP), and left-ventricular ejection time (LVET) time series for a representative subject during supine rest condition (load physio_data_1subj.mat).
